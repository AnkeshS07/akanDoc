Dear Sir,

I hope this email finds you well. As a Node.js Developer at
 Xicom Technologies Ltd.
 I would like to provide you with an update on my daily tasks.
Here is a summary of the tasks I completed today:
Today, I focused on enhancing the validation logic for the Zflix project's
 backend. I improved the validation rules and error handling to ensure
 the security and accuracy of user data.Additionally, I merged the sign-up 
and forget password OTP APIs into a single API, eliminating redundancy 
and improving maintainability.Moreover, I created a dedicated API for 
sending mail to new users. This will streamline communication and

 enhance the onboarding process. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need more details 

about these tasks.
Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
